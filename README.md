# Behavioral-Security-Engine-MOI  
MVP prototype for behavioral anomaly detection during digital sessions, based on the Silent Trigger Theory™.

---

## 🧭 Overview
This repository hosts the MVP prototype developed for the Ministry of Interior Hackathon.  
The system detects behavioral anomalies during digital interactions by applying logic from **Silent Trigger Theory™**—a Saudi behavioral model designed to identify “silent precursors of risk” through micro-pattern analysis.

The prototype was implemented using **Manus AI** to simulate a real security engine capable of monitoring:

- Typing rhythm & writing behavior  
- Navigation style & page-switch timing  
- Copy–paste vs. manual typing anomalies  
- Session stability & device changes  
- Geo-consistency checks  
- STARC 5-dimensional scoring model  
- STAR-Cycle decision engine (closed-loop model)

## 🎯 Hackathon Objective
To demonstrate how behavioral signals—before any criminal or unauthorized action—can reinforce identity verification and detect account misuse in real time.

This MVP showcases how Silent Trigger Theory™ can support Absher, Nafath, and other MOI digital services by adding a predictive, user-centric security layer.

## 🧩 Silent Trigger Theory™ (Core Framework)
A Saudi-born predictive model developed by **Yazeed Saud AlMutairi**, officially published with DOI:

🔗 https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15732971

### **STARC Dimensions (0–4 Scale)**
1. **Shift** – Sudden deviations from baseline behavior  
2. **Traceability** – Loss of consistent digital footprint  
3. **Ambiguity** – Unclear or conflicting interaction patterns  
4. **Risk-Link** – Connection to historically risky patterns  
5. **Corrective Loop** – System learning and recalibration  

### **STAR-Cycle (Closed-Loop Engine)**
Detection → Verification → Logging → Analysis → Execution  
Used for dynamic and adaptive response.
